Blinkit Sales Analysis | SQL Server & Power BI

This project analyzes Blinkit’s sales performance using SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for dashboard development. The objective is to understand sales patterns, identify top-performing outlets, evaluate product categories, and generate insights that support data-driven decision-making.

🔹 Project Overview

The raw dataset was imported into MS SQL Server, where initial data cleaning and validation were performed. SQL queries were used to check data quality, remove duplicates, handle missing values, and verify category consistency. Preliminary analysis such as total sales, outlet-wise revenue, and category-wise performance was also carried out using aggregation queries.

After preparing the data, the cleaned tables were connected to Power BI for visualization. Power Query was used for additional transformations, and DAX was used to build dynamic KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Rating, Total Items, and Outlet Performance.

🔹 Outcome

The analysis highlights actionable insights such as bestselling categories, underperforming items, outlet strengths, and customer preferences. The interactive dashboard allows users to explore trends and filter results based on product category, outlet type, and ratings.

This project demonstrates practical skills in SQL-based data processing, data modeling, and business intelligence dashboard creation.
